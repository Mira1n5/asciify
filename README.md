# asciify

Simple Rust-based tool to convert images into ASCII art and export as '.png'. I did this to learn Rust :P. There may be updates in the future.

⚠️ Currently, output is saved to ascii.output.png and will be overwritten.
Please duplicate and rename your image before generating a new one.
This will be improved in a future update!

## Installation

You need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

cargo install --git https://github.com/Mira1n5/asciify

## Usage

asciify <image_path>
